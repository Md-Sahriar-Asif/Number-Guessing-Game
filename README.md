# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a very beginner level project. Here, the program will generate a number by itself and users have to guess the number within 5 chances. There are three different levels in this game. This program will store the highest score of every player and store it in user_profile.txt file. It will also record the statistics of every player, for instance their name, their number of attempt, if they lose the game or not. These things will be stored in the user_statistics.txt file.
Remember the highest score of this game is 1 and lowest score is 5.
